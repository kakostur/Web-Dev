        <p><strong>Steps:</strong> Start by making the crust: combine 2 cups of flour with about 1/2 cup of water, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough lightly, then roll it out into two thin circles—one for the base and one for the top. For the filling, peel, core, and slice the apples, and sprinkle them with a little flour to help thicken their juices while baking. Line a pie dish or an oven-safe pan with one dough circle, add the apples as the filling, and cover with the second dough circle. Seal the edges by pressing them together and cut small slits in the top to let steam escape. Bake the pie in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 40-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the apples are soft. It’s simple but satisfying!

        <p><strong>Steps:</strong> Start by preparing a basic dough: mix 2 cups of flour with about 3/4 cup of water and knead until smooth. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes while you prepare the pasta topping. Cook the pasta until al dente and drain. Roll out the dough into a thin, round shape and place it on a baking sheet or in a skillet. Spread the cooked pasta evenly on top of the dough as the "sauce" base. Sprinkle generously with shredded cheese, ensuring even coverage. Bake in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. This pizza-pasta hybrid is unconventional but delicious!

        <p><strong>Steps:</strong> Dice the meat (lamb or beef works well) into bite-sized pieces, peel and cut the carrots into thin strips, and rinse 2 cups of rice until the water runs clear. Heat a large pot or deep pan over medium heat and brown the meat with a little oil or water if needed, seasoning it with salt for flavor. Add the carrots and cook until they soften slightly. Next, spread the rinsed rice evenly over the meat and carrots without mixing. Pour enough water to cover the rice by about 1 inch (2-3 cm) and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer until the rice absorbs all the water and becomes tender (about 20-25 minutes). Once done, gently fluff the plov and serve hot. It's a simple yet hearty dish!
