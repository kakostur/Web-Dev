        <p id="info-hawaii">Hawaii, the 50th state of the United States, is an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean. Known as the “Aloha State,” it is famous for its stunning landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and vibrant ecosystem. Hawaii’s state capital is Honolulu, located on the island of Oahu.</p>
        <p class="tourism">Hawaii is not just a paradise for tourists but also a hub of scientific and ecological significance. The islands are home to some of the world’s most important observatories, such as the Mauna Kea Observatory, taking advantage of its clear skies and high altitude. Hawaii’s unique flora and fauna, including species like the nēnē (Hawaiian goose) and the silversword plant, are found nowhere else on Earth. The state's agricultural exports include pineapples, sugarcane, and macadamia nuts. Its waters are rich with marine biodiversity, making it a global hotspot for whale watching and coral reef conservation. Beyond its natural beauty, Hawaii’s warm and welcoming culture, symbolized by the spirit of "aloha," continues to draw people from around the world.</p>
